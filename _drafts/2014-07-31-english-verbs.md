title: Verbs, 英语中的动词
---

无意中发现 [EnglishClub](http://www.englishclub.com/) 这个网站. 是一个新手学习的好地方, 因为连我这样的英语渣也能基本看懂.

用汉语来解释英语是件蹩脚的事情, 所以还是看英文教学比较好. 虽学习曲线陡峭, 但值得一试. 下面是动词方面的一些摘抄.


### What are Verbs?

The verb is king in English. The shortest sentence contains a verb. You can make a one-word sentence with a verb, for example: "Stop!" But you cannot make a one-word sentence with any other type of word.

Verbs are sometimes described as "action words". Many verbs give the idea of action. For example: run, fight, do. Some verbs give the idea of existence, of state, of "beging". For example: be, exist, belong.

A verb always has a subject. Web can say that verbs are words that tell us what a subject **does** or **is**; they describe: **action** or **state**.


### Helping Verbs (auxiliary verbs)

Helping verbs have no meaning on their own. The do not tell us much alone, and they "help" main verbs.

* Primary helping verbs (3): be, have, do
* Modal helping verbs (10): can/could, may/might, will/would, shall/should, must, ought to
* Semi-modal verbs (3): need, dare, used to


### Main Verbs (lexical verbs)

Main berbs have meaning on their own (unlike helping verbs).

* Transitive and intransitive verbs. A transitive verb takes a direct object. An intransitive verb does not have a direct object.
* Linking verbs. A linking ver does not have much meaning in itself. It "links" the subject to what is said about the subject.
* Dynamic and stative verbs. Dynamic verbs describe action, and can be used with continuous tenses. Stative verbs describe state, and cannot normally be used with continuous tenses.
* Regular and irregular verbs. The only real difference is that they have different endings for their past tense and past participle forms.
